# Illuminating Dark Tribes with Watson

Recent studies by Gartner L2 have uncovered that "Micro Tribe" influencers in Social Media provide up to 600% more revenue return than traditional advertising sources. Are you utilizing the power of these brand influencers? IBM's Watson can fingerprint the critical personality traits of these Tribes thru their Dark Social interaction - allowing you to easily match similar Tribes with meaningful Brand Plays across the breadth of your portfolio.


Watson Personality Insights powers this demo. It predicts personality characteristics, needs and values through written text. Understand your customersâ€™ habits and preferences on an individual level, and at Micro Tribe scale.

IBM Dynamic Dashboard Embedded powers these visulizations. It is a new, API-based solution that lets developers easily add end-to-end data visualization capabilities to their applications so users can create visualizations that feel like part of the app.

Watson Machine Learning selects our tribe promotion. Use your own data to create, train, and deploy ML & deep learning models. Leverage an automated, collaborative workflow to grow intelligent business applications easily and with more confidence.
