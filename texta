President Donald J. Trump said he gets "a big, big kick" out of establishment political actors telling him what to do with North Korea. https://fxn.ws/2HAzCrh
The Law of Attraction - What we think we become I've learnt with time that those who have to leave will do so no matter what you do.. Forever is a lie.. Yet the statement is partially right because, remember, those who stay will always be there.. It is up to you to choose well.. Don't blame life..
‚ÄúThis is a big deal and there‚Äôs one person who was more responsible than anybody else for it, and that is President Trump.‚Äù
Matt Enders Give the credit where it is due. Congratulations. President Donald J. Trump.

Moments ago on "Hannity," Judge Jeanine Pirro gave her take on the uproar that has occurred on the left after Kanye West expressed a pro-Donald J. Trump message. https://bit.ly/2HyfaXQ
Josh Harrison That‚Äôs odd, it reminds me of a much more recent event where a celebrity made a political statement - Colin Kapaernick‚Äôs stance on police brutality. I think Fox and Pirro had a few things to say about that. I guess those must of been reminiscent of McCarthyism, but I don‚Äôt recall them saying so.
"Investigators found no evidence of collusion or coordination of any kind between the Russian government and the Donald J. Trump for Preside nt campaign. None." ‚Äì Tucker Carlson
Jason Hoyt Wow the Republicans found no evidence of collusion that's just like when the police say that after investigating themselves they found that they did no wrong doing.
Daniel Vieira Trump is going to try and take credit for this too.

Jeanne Shillingburg Bean President Trump is a better example of achieving your dreams, then most of you,making the nasty comments about him. Thanks President Trump for caring about our young people!
Pete Koukos And it keeps coming!! I‚Äôm glad the Black community in this country are starting to realize that The Democrats have done nothing for them!!! Diamond and silk said it from day one!

Yeah, we notice your hypocrisy
Phillip Day So Trump made sure to call and congratulate Roseanne on her TV ratings but has never called the hero that stopped the wafflehouse mass shooting....He's black! Your Republican leader seems to have race issues!!!
Moments ago, Hillary Clinton called for the FEC to allow candidates to use campaign funds for childcare when they‚Äôre on the trail.
Is this a good idea?

IF TRUMP WON'T HONOR HIM, WE WILL!!!!
Steve Ohlde This sheriff is not a leader. His career is over but he‚Äôll fight it to the end blaming everyone else. He‚Äôs not a leader and he needs to get out of way so the officers in that department can move ahead.

Nancy Jones Dems just can‚Äôt stand it. Melania has brought the most class to the White House since Jacqueline Kennedy.
Danny Blocker I'm sure Melania was uncomfortable being there, having to sit next to Obama and crooked Hillary... but she did it, she did it with character, she did it with Integrity, and she did it with class!! my hats off to our First Lady Melania, you accomplished your mission, by being there as our First Lady to pay your respects on behalf of the United States!! for that, WE THANK YOU
Moments ago on "The Five," Candace Owens slammed liberals for stifling independent thought. https://bit.ly/2HyfaXQ
David Kennett The problem with liberals is that they have no real defense for their position so when challenged they have to respond with name calling and "racism". Independent thought is their Achilles Heel.
Omod Galli Fox supports freedom of speech as long as something they agree with lol. They told Lebron to shut and dribble but won‚Äôt tell Kanye to shut and rap.

Anthony Hollander So sad that Trump is so jealous of Obama that he just can't stop putting him down.Trump knows he will never even come close to being the fine human being Obama is.
David Moore Wait, so you are allowed to insult and name-call students who dont support the 2nd amendment (as is their right to freedom of speech); but ya'll wanna hang this guy for using his freedom of speech to name-call a student whose pro-2nd amendment?? ü§îü§îü§îüòÇüòÇüòÇ
